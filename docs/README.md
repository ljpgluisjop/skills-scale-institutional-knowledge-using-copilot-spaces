# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome — this folder centralizes OctoAcme's project management processes, checklists, and templates so teams can onboard quickly, deliver reliably, and iterate with confidence.

## Project Management Processes — Overview
OctoAcme uses a clear, iterative lifecycle to deliver value reliably:

- Initiation  
  Capture the problem, goals, primary stakeholders, and measurable success metrics. Create a Project One-pager to summarize scope, timeline, and early risks.

- Planning  
  Break work into shippable increments, prioritize the backlog, estimate effort, identify dependencies and risks, and produce a release/milestone plan.

- Execution & Tracking  
  Follow an agile rhythm (standups, sprint planning, demos). Use the project board and small PRs, enforce CI gating and review policies, track velocity/burndown, and surface blockers early.

- Release & Deployment  
  Use a risk-managed release checklist: pre-release checks, smoke tests, rollback plans, and stakeholder communication. Automate deploy pipelines where possible.

- Retrospective & Continuous Improvement  
  Run retrospectives after sprints, releases, or incidents, convert learnings into action items, and track their impact over time.

Core roles are defined (Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA) with clear responsibilities. Success is measured by customer value, agreed success metrics, and timely delivery with manageable risk.
